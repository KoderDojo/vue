I have various pens on CodePen showcasing Vue.js features. You can view my entire [Vue.js Collection](https://codepen.io/collection/DworBa/) or the individual Vue.js examples.

* [Vue.js Components - Passing Dynamic Properties with Props](https://codepen.io/koderdojo/pen/PjNZyB): A Vue.js example that shows how to pass dynamic properties from the parent to child components using props. The example also shows how to validate those properties using Vue.js built-in validators.
* [Vue.JS Component - Parent Communication using $emit](https://codepen.io/koderdojo/pen/qjZbdO): Vue.js example that shows how a component can communicate and pass data to the parent by emitting an event using $emit. The parent will listen for the event and access the data from $event. The example also shows how to use Vue.js $refs to access an element in the DOM. In this case I am setting the focus back to the Input element when the name is changed.
* [Vuex Centralized State Management for Vue.js Web Applications](https://codepen.io/koderdojo/pen/eRZZPE): A simple example of using Vuex to provide centralized state management in Vue.js Web Applications. Demonstrates how to perform mutations on a store object and how those changes are propagated to the parent and its child components.
* [Vue.js Filter Example using v-for Directive and Vuex](https://codepen.io/koderdojo/pen/QgELYy): A Vue.js example that uses the v-for directive to display a list of students in a Vuex store. The sample also illustrates how to filter the list of students using two-way model binding and a computed property.
* [Vue.js Event Bus for Component to Component Communication](https://codepen.io/koderdojo/pen/Moeebv): This Vue.js example shows how to create a new Vue instance as an event bus to allow component to component communications without involving the parent component.
* [Vue.js Directive](https://codepen.io/koderdojo/pen/GEjXop): A Vue.js example on how to create a custom directive that showcases arguments, values, and modifiers as well as the 'bind' lifestyle event. In this case the directive is declared globally using Vue.directive. One can optionally use the argument 'background' as well as use a modifier 'delay'. The idea was taken from a Vue.js class, but I built the directive from scratch without help using the learned concepts.
* [Custom Vue.js Directive With Event Listeners](https://codepen.io/koderdojo/pen/pwEGpX): A custom Vue.js Directive that is registered locally and uses the 'bind' and 'unbind' events to register and unregister event listeners. The directive also takes an object as a value that specifies both the color and background color of the html element during mouseenter.
* [Custom Vue.js Filter](https://codepen.io/koderdojo/pen/LLbLJB): A custom Vue.js filter example that capitalizes the value passed to it. The filter is registered globally in this instance using Vue.filter.
* [Vue.js Mixin](https://codepen.io/koderdojo/pen/mwRdQv): A Vue.js example that creates a global mixin that gets merged with the main Vue.js instance as well as a Vue.js component. Notice how the data is actually merged with each Vue instance and changing the data in one does not change the data in the other. Extending Vue with components, directives, filters, and mixins is awesome!
* [Vue.js Transition to Animate Single Element](https://codepen.io/koderdojo/pen/YQNWGe): Vue.js example using transition to animate a single element using custom css classes that transition the opacity of a bootstrap alert component.
* [Basic Vue-Router Example](https://codepen.io/koderdojo/pen/rwQvbN): A quick example of Vue-Router in Vue.js. Shows how to create routes and use router-view and router-link in your single-page web applications.
* [Vue.js Vue-Router with Dynamic Routes](https://codepen.io/koderdojo/pen/NgEBKq): Example of using Vue-Router and Vuex in Vue.js to display a list of contacts and define dynamic routes to view each contact on a separate path.
* [Vuetify with Vuex and VueRouter](https://codepen.io/koderdojo/pen/MozqVL): Example of using Vuetify with Vue.js, Vuex, and VueRouter to display a list of contacts and contact detail.
